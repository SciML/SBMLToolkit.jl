There are multiple ways to specify the same model in SBML. Please help us improve SBMLToolkit.jl by creating a GitHub issue if you experience errors when converting your SBML model.\n\nSBMLToolkit uses the SBML.jl wrapper of the libSBML library to lower dynamical SBML models into dynamical systems. If you would like to import BioNetGen models, use the writeSBML() export function or import the .net file with ReactionNetworkImporters.jl. For constrained-based modeling, please have a look at COBREXA.jl.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"To install SBMLToolkit.jl, use the Julia package manager:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"SBMLToolkit\")","category":"section"},{"location":"#Contributing","page":"Home","title":"Contributing","text":"Please refer to the SciML ColPrac: Contributor's Guide on Collaborative Practices for Community Packages for guidance on PRs, issues, and other matters relating to contributing to SciML.\nSee the SciML Style Guide for common coding practices and other style decisions.\nThere are a few community forums:\nThe #diffeq-bridged and #sciml-bridged channels in the Julia Slack\nThe #diffeq-bridged and #sciml-bridged channels in the Julia Zulip\nOn the Julia Discourse forums\nSee also SciML Community page","category":"section"},{"location":"#Tutorial","page":"Home","title":"Tutorial","text":"SBML models can be simulated with the following steps (note that sol is in absolute quantities rather than concentrations):\n\nusing SBMLToolkit, ModelingToolkit, OrdinaryDiffEq\n\nSBMLToolkit.checksupport_file(\"my_model.xml\")\nmdl = readSBML(\"my_model.xml\", doc -> begin\n    set_level_and_version(3, 2)(doc)\n    convert_promotelocals_expandfuns(doc)\nend)\nrs = ReactionSystem(mdl)  # If you want to create a reaction system\nodesys = convert(ODESystem, rs)  # Alternatively: ODESystem(mdl)\n\ntspan = (0.0, 1.0)\nprob = ODEProblem(odesys, [], tspan, [])\nsol = solve(prob, Tsit5())\n\nSBMLToolkit also provides the following convenience functions to import SBML.Models, Catalyst.ReactionSystems and ModelingToolkit.ODESystems:\n\nmdl = readSBML(sbmlfile, DefaultImporter())\nrs = readSBML(sbmlfile, ReactionSystemImporter())\nodesys = readSBML(sbmlfile, ODESystemImporter())","category":"section"},{"location":"#License","page":"Home","title":"License","text":"The package is released under the MIT license.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Development-team","page":"Home","title":"Development team","text":"This package was developed by Paul F.
